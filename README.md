Description:

A simple web-based robot simulation for educational purpose.
User can interact with the robot by using the GUI provided.

Folders:

1. MATLAB: contains the dynamics and controller implemented on .m files
2. WebGL: contains the web-based GUI programs 

The purpose of this simple, yet very useful project is twofold. The first one concerns about the 
educational aspect of the project which aims to explore the role of interactive visualization 
in accelerating learning process. The second one deals with technical aspect: as an exercise
to computer graphics library (WebGL) and to study a relatively new concept in robotics - [geometry and screw theory] (http://www2.moundsviewschools.org/chippewa/userfiles/depiesj/geometry_and_screw_theory_for_robotics.pdf).
